| -XX:+UseG1GC                         | Use the Garbage First (G1) Collector                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=n               | Sets a target for the maximum GC pause time. This is a soft goal, and the JVM will make its best effort to achieve it. |
| -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=n | Percentage of the (entire) heap occupancy to start a concurrent GC cycle. It is used by GCs that trigger a concurrent GC cycle based on the occupancy of the entire heap, not just one of the generations (e.g., G1). A value of 0 denotes 'do constant GC cycles'. The default value is 45. |
| -XX:NewRatio=n                       | Ratio of new/old generation sizes. The default value is 2.   |
| -XX:SurvivorRatio=n                  | Ratio of eden/survivor space size. The default value is 8.   |
| -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=n           | Maximum value for tenuring threshold. The default value is 15. |
| -XX:ParallelGCThreads=n              | Sets the number of threads used during parallel phases of the garbage collectors. The default value varies with the platform on which the JVM is running. |
| -XX:ConcGCThreads=n                  | Number of threads concurrent garbage collectors will use. The default value varies with the platform on which the JVM is running. |
| -XX:G1ReservePercent=n               | Sets the amount of heap that is reserved as a false ceiling to reduce the possibility of promotion failure. The default value is 10. |
| -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=n               | With G1 the Java heap is subdivided into uniformly sized regions. This sets the size of the individual sub-divisions. The default value of this parameter is determined ergonomically based upon heap size. The minimum value is 1Mb and the maximum value is 32Mb. |
